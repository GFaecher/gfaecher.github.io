    <h1>Analog Pulse Oximeter</h1>

    <p>
        In my analog electronics course, I was tasked with designing and wiring 
        a rudimentary pulse oximeter. The output of our device can be measured 
        on an oscilloscope and is a function of the amount of light that passes
        through a finger. On a high level, an infrared LED points towards a 
        phototransistor, and the amount of light that passes through the finger 
        is measured by the phototransistor, amplified by a bandpass filter, and 
        shifted by a voltage follower to ensure that the output is within a 
        five volt range. There is also a reference voltage used to ensure that 
        the phototransistor's output is more consistent.
    </p>

    <p>
        The final circuit is shown below. The smaller breadboard on top is where 
        the phototransistor and infrared LED are located, as well as the voltage 
        follower. The larger breadboard on the bottom contains the bandpass filter and the reference voltage, 
        which utiliz multiple op-amps to both limit the frequencies that can 
        pass through the circuit and amplify the signal.

                <u><strong>Bandpass Filter:</strong></u>

                    The bandpass filter, depicted on top right, consists of three 
                    stages. The first stage is a high pass filter, which uses a 
                    capacitor at the input to block DC signals. And, due to the 
                    choice of resistor and capacitor values, the cutoff frequency is 
                    set to 0.5 Hz. The second stage is a low pass filter, which 
                    uses a capacitor in parallel with the feebdack resistor to 
                    limit high frequency signals. The cutoff frequency is set to 4 Hz
                    using the same method as the high pass filter. The final stage
                    is the voltage follower, which uses a non-inverting op-amp 
                    along with another power source to ensure that the output is
                    within a 5 volt range.
            </p>

            <p>
                <u><strong>Sensor:</strong></u>
                The sensor, depicted in the top left, consists of an infrared LED and a 
                phototransistor. The infrared LED emits light, which passes through 
                a finger and is detected by the phototransistor. The amount of voltage 
                across the phototransistor is dependent on the amount of light that
                passes through the finger, which itself is dependent
                on the amount of oxygen in the blood of the finger. The brightness 
                of the LED is controlled partially by the reference voltage, which 
                itself attenuates high frequency noise that could interefere with 
                readings.
                    

            </p>

            <p>
                <u><strong>Feedback Reference Voltage:</strong></u>

                    The feedback reference voltage, depicted on the bottom, 
                    consists of a zener diode and a low pass filter. The zener 
                    diode is used to limit the input of the positive terminal of 
                    the op-amp to 5 volts. The low pass filter is used to filter 
                    out any high frequency noise that may be present in the output 
                    of the phototransistor, and adjust the amount of light coming 
                    out of the infrared LED accordingly.

        Multiple LTSpice simpulations were run to ensure that the circuit was
        functioning before physically wiring it. Overall, the circuit functioned 
        as expected, and taught me a lot about the importance of testing before 
        implementation and thorough design practices.
