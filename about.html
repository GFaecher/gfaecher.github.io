        <div class="text-bio">
            <p>
                My name is Griffin Faecher, and I am a rising senior at Tufts Universtiy 
                studying computer engineering with a minor in computer science. I have 
                a passion for embedded systems, computer architecture, and the alto 
                saxophone. I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my growing 
                knowledge and skills in a professional setting. I have a strong 
                foundation in programming languages such as C, C++, and VHDL, and am 
                eager to contribute to teams across a plethora of fields regarding 
                computer engineering. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have extensive professional experience in engineering roles at TRC 
                Companies, where I participated in projects across multiple diciplines. 
                I began as an environmental intern where i assisted in the collection 
                and analysis of data for environmental cleanup projects. Next summer, I 
                transitioned to a more technical role as a geospatial intern. I 
                annotated power station imagery for the YOLO object detection model, 
                and wrote shell scripts to automate the data collection process.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also been involved in a number of positions at Tufts. I 
                was an undergraduate research assistant for Professor Paul 
                Simmonds, where i assisted in the analysis of III-V 
                semiconductors. I was also a teaching assistant for Tufts's 
                Digital Logic Design course, where I ran weekly lab sessions to 
                teach students how to utilize VHDL to design a large scale 
                final project. I was also a teaching assistant for Tufts's 
                Embedded Systems course, where I taught students how to use C 
                to program an STM-Nucleo microcontroller to interact with a 
                plethora of different peripherals.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I come to my final year of my undergraduate studies, I am excited to explore
                opportunities in embedded systems, computer architecture, and 
                whatever lies in between. Please, feel free to reach out via email or 
                LinkedIn!
