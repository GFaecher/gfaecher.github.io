    <h1>Griffin's Platformer: Jacqued Jumper</h1>

    <p>
        In our project, Jacques Jumper, you control a humanoid frog named 
        Jacques. His goal is to survive by jumping in between falling platforms. 
        If he comes in contact with the bottom of the screen or jumps too high 
        and leaves the screen, Jacques dies and the game is over. You can move 
        Jacques left or right by using the respective buttons on an NES controller. 
        To jump upward, the user can either press the B button to get a short but 
        quick jump or hold the A button to charge up and jump across the screen. 
        There is no specific win condition to our game. Your only mission is to 
        charge your jumps and cleverly choose which platform to land to avoid losing.
    </p>

    <p>
        At a high level, our project starts at our VGA module. This is where we 
        get the 60 Hz clock that we use in the majority of our other modules. 
        We have a game state module that ends the game when Jacques has passed 
        away and begins the game when the user presses the start button on the 
        NES controller. The position, movement, and interaction between all of 
        the “entities” is then calculated in our physics module. This includes 
        the platforms and Jacques himself. Finally, the pattern generator module 
        draws in the characters, platforms, and background from our ROM files and 
        displays them onto the screen depending on which game state the user is 
        currently in.

            <u><strong>VGA:</strong></u>
                The VGA module takes input from a PLL, a high speed oscillating 
                clock that outputs pulses at a rate of 25 MHz. It then uses that 
                clock to drive a row and column signal. These two signals drive 
                the pixels of the screen such that on each pulse, a new pixel is 
                drawn in a column and after 800 pixels are drawn in a column, the 
                column resets and draws in the next row down. While this sounds 
                complex, ultimately what it allows us to do is draw 640x480 pixels 
                at 60Hz meaning we effectively have a 60Hz refresh rate screen upon 
                which we can base the rest of our game off of. From the VGA module, 
                we outputted a 60Hz clock signal that we used to drive the rest of our 
                modules. The row and column individually were also outputted to Pattern 
                Generation for some difference calculations.
        </p>

            <u><strong>Controller Inputs:</strong></u>
            The controller module relies on three different variables: data input, 
            latch, clock. We get the clock to time the controller with the FPGA's 
            internal high oscillating clock. We then slow down this clock to a 
            suitable pace for the controller to handle, and use a latch that would 
            tell the controller when to check for inputs. There were eight total 
            buttons, and if one of them is held down after the latch goes off, the 
            controller will output a high at the specific time as seen in the graph 
            below. These outputs would then be stored in a shift register, with 
            each bit representing a different input from the controller.

            <u><strong>Character Sprite:</strong></u>
                Since Jacques is an original character, the artwork for each 
                character sprite had to be created from scratch. The process of 
                creating Jacques involved photoshopping a frog mask onto a bodybuilder's 
                body, which would in turn give us the character we intended to make 
                (a muscular, human-like frog). The photoshopped image would then be 
                transferred to a website that would pixelate the image with a 6-bit 
                color palette, giving us a pixelated version of Jacques. All images 
                were assigned a “transparent color” value which filled the extra space 
                in the box they were generated in. This would become the “others” 
                case in our ROM. This value acted as a garbage value that would not 
                be generated on screen, while all other pixel values for Jacques would. 
                After refining and color-correcting the image, it was then turned into 
                a file that would be read by a C++ script, turning each pixel into a line 
                used in a ROM file. Jacques would have to have a total of 9 different 
                sprites that represented each animation we wanted to implement. Note 
                that we simply mirrored the left and right sprites in order to save space.

            <u><strong>Physics Engine:</strong></u>

                The physics engine forms the foundation of gameplay, handling all 
                movement and collisions between Jacques and the platforms. We 
                designed it around a 60 Hz clock, which updates position and 
                velocity signals every frame. Four core constants—gravity, run 
                acceleration, friction, and collision leniency—govern the physics 
                behaviors. Horizontal movement is driven by acceleration and 
                capped by a terminal velocity; once reached, Jacques glides at 
                a constant speed until friction slows him down when input stops. 
                Vertically, Jacques interacts with constantly falling platforms, 
                which are repositioned via an LFSR when they exit the screen. 
                Collisions are predicted one frame ahead using lookahead calculations. 
                If Jacques is detected to be landing, a flag is triggered to “lock” him 
                on the platform and sync his vertical speed. Only when this flag is high 
                can Jacques perform his jumps: a short hop with a button press, or a 
                charged jump based on how long the button is held. This balance of anticipation 
                and player control makes the movement smooth and responsive.

            <u><strong>Game States:</strong></u>

                We had two variables working in tandem to determine what game state 
                we were in. One named death which kept track of when Jacques had 
                moved onto the next realm, and the other named states told the pattern 
                generator which screen to display and when the physics should run. 
                Both values initialize to 0, and the user begins at our tiled brick 
                start screen. Once the user presses the start button on the NES 
                controller, states receive a value of 1 and Jacques spawns in the 
                middle of the screen at the top on a platform. This is also when 
                the physics module begins to run, and the game runs as normal. This 
                continues until Jacques reaches a death condition, whether that be 
                him hitting the top of the screen or him hitting the bottom of the 
                screen. This turns the death variable to one, turning the state variable 
                back to 0 and sending the player to the start screen. This cycle 
                repeats, except every time the player hits the start button again, 
                death is set to 0 and the game can run for as long as the user would like.
