    <h1>Self Navigating Robotic Vehicle</h1>

    <p>
        In my Junior Design course, I and three of my classmates were 
        tasked with designing, programming, and building a self-navigating 
        robotic vehicle. The vehicle was required to follow colored lanes, 
        avoid wall collisions, and communicate with a central server.
    </p>

    <p>
        There were two main paths the vehicle needed to follow: track A and 
        track B. Track A is depicted below, and the only difference between 
        track A and track B is that track B follows the blue path. The vehicle 
        was required to complete these tracks both solo, and in tandem with 
        a partner group. This tasked both groups to plan ahead for 
        collisions to ensure that each group's vehicle would not interfere 
        with the other's path.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
        The project was divided into two main components: hardware and 
        software. The hardware component involved an H-Bridge for motor 
        control, infrared sensors for collision detection, and 
        phototransistors for color sensing. A 3D-printed chassis was also 
        designed to ensure efficient component placement on our vehicle.
        The software component involved embedded C programming on an 
        Arduino UNO microcontroller and the implementation of a WebSocket client 
        for real-time communication between vehicles. An OLED display was 
        also included to provide visual feedback on the vehicle's state.

                <u><strong>H-Bridge Motor Control:</strong></u>

                    An H-Bridge is a circuit we used to control the direction and speed 
                of the DC motors on our vehicle. It allowed us to reverse the 
                polarity of the voltage applied to the motors without any risk of 
                damaging the components. The H-bridge connects to PWM pins on the 
                Arduino, allowing us to control the speed and direction of the motors.
            </p>

            <p>
                <u><strong>Collision Detection: </strong></u>

                    A phototransistor and an infrared LED were attached to the front 
                of the vehicle for collision detection. The light that the LED emits
                is reflected off of walls and detected by the phototransistor. The 
                voltage across the phototransistor is dependent on the amount of 
                reflected light, and if under a specified threshold, instruct the 
                vehicle to turn away from the wall.

            </p>

            <p>
                <u><strong>Lane following: </strong></u>

                    Two photodiodes were attached to each side of the vehicle to act 
                    as its eyes. Next to the photodiodes were red and blue LEDs. These 
                    would flash on and off, and the photodiodes would detect the 
                    amount of light reflected off the ground. Then, depending on what 
                    path the vehicle was on, the Arduino would follow pre-determined 
                    logic to steer the vehicle in the correct direction.

            </p>

            <p>
                <u><strong>OLED Screen: </strong></u>

                    The OLED screen proved to be a helpful addition in not only 
                    debugging but also providing an asthetic touch to the vehicle. The
                    screen displays what track the vehicle is following at the 
                    beginning of the run, and then displays the vehicle's current 
                    objective as it moves through the track.

        All of these components, except for the motors, were powered by a 
        9V battery. It proved to be a reliable power source for the 
        components that were not incredibly power hungry. The motors, 
        however, were powered by a 6V battery pack. Although at a smaller 
        voltage, the motors were able to draw more current from the pack 
        and not lose power nearly as quickly.
